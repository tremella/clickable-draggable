TODOS

NOTE: pointerTracker 2.4.0 was broken for me ðŸ˜¢, had to revert to an older version.

- import pointer tracker
    - set up a tracker, give it very basic reactions (console.logs?)

- create a page with a shape
    - basics of how to alter x and y? [DONE]
    - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp

- transitions:
    - what does myImg.style.transition do? google it
    - looks like the stylesheet updates constantly in pinch-zoom. nice.
