GOALS

[ DONE ] Drag the element around using a single finger/pointer
Add a button that smoothly animates the original element back to the centre
Resize the element using two fingers (ideally this works nicely with 1.)
Keep the edges of the target element within a bounded region which is 20px from the edges of the screen (what happens when the screen is resized?)
Prevent the target element from getting resized to more than 4x, nor less than 1/4 of its original size
